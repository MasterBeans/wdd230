      <h3>History</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>October 20, 1947</h4>
        <p>Ormoc became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 179, 
          becoming the fifteenth city in the Philippines and the 
          first in the Eastern Visayas region.</p>

        <h4>November 5, 1991</h4>
        <p>On the morning of 5 November 1991, the Ormoc region was 
          inundated by Tropical Storm Uring. The city government recorded 
          4,922 deaths, 3,000 missing persons, 14,000 destroyed houses and 
          more than P600 million worth of damaged property. </p>

        <h4>November 7, 2013</h4>
        <p>Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever 
      recorded, made a landfall in the Philippines. While it killed far 
      fewer people as Tropical Storm Uring, it left widespread devastation 
      to the city with destruction and damages in 90% of its structures.</p>

      <h3>Demographics</h3>
      
      <p>The natives of this city are called Ormocanons, with most being 
        Cebuano speakers, as with the whole western and southern parts of 
        the island of Leyte. A definite number of Waray speakers is also 
        present within the city.

        Like most Filipinos, Ormocanons are predominantly Roman Catholic, 
        and the city celebrates its annual fiesta in honour of the patron 
        saints Saint Peter and Saint Paul on June 28 and 29. Other main 
        Catholic holy days, including the local fiestas of barangays, are 
        observed throughout the year. There is also a visible Muslim minority 
        within the city and all over the island, evidenced by the mosques within 
        the cityscape and most of them are Maranaos from the twin provinces of 
        Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur in Mindanao.</p>

      <h3>Economy</h3>
      
      <p>Ormoc's economic base is a mix of agriculture, aquaculture, industry, 
        tourism, and commercial services. Sugar cane, rice and pineapple are the 
        major agricultural production.

        The city enjoys economic growth because it supplies a large part of the 
        country's power needs with its abundant geothermal power resources from 
        the Tongonan Geothermal Power Plant in Barangay Tongonan and the neighbouring 
        Kananga town. Ormoc is also the gateway to the Leyte Industrial Development 
        Estate in the nearby town of Isabel, home of the Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer 
        Plant, the largest fertilizer factory in Asia, and the Philippine Associated Smelter 
        and Refining Company, the country's biggest copper processing plant, among other industries.</p>
